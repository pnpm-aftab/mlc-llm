Okay, the user wants a detailed explanation of photosynthesis, including chlorophyll, light-dependent reactions, and the Calvin cycle. They also want to know how these processes contribute to producing glucose and oxygen. Let me start by breaking down each component.

First, chlorophyll is essential. I remember that it's the pigment in plants that captures light. Then, the light-dependent reactions. These involve the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, probably in the presence of ATP and NADPH. Then the Calvin cycle, which is the process of converting carbon dioxide into glucose. 

Wait, how do these processes contribute to glucose and oxygen? Oh right, the glucose comes from the Calvin cycle, and oxygen is released during the light-dependent"

Okay, the user wants a summary of quantum mechanics core principles, including superposition, entanglement, and wave-particle duality, and how these differ from classical physics. Let me start by recalling what I know.

First, superposition: in classical physics, particles have definite states (like spin 0 or 1), but quantum mechanics allows them to be in a superposition of states. So that's a key difference. Then entanglement: particles can affect each other even if they're far apart, which is a quantum phenomenon. Wave-particle duality: particles can behave like waves, which is another core concept.

Now, how do these principles differ from classical? Classical physics is deterministic, with definite states and"
